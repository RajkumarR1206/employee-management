How to Run Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RajkumarR1206/employee-management.git
cd employee-management
````

### 2. Configure MySQL

1. Make sure MySQL is installed and running.

2. Create the database:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE ems_db;
   ```

3. Update `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3307/ems_db
   spring.datasource.username=root
   spring.datasource.password=yourpassword

   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   spring.jpa.show-sql=true
   ```

 Make sure `server.port` is set if not default:

```properties
server.port=8082
```

---

### 3. Build and Run

```bash
# Build the project
mvn clean install

# Run the app
mvn spring-boot:run
```

 By default, the app runs on: [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082)
